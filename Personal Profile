I can highly relate to the Myers-Briggs test the most amongst all 3 tests I took. Although at times I do like socializing and working with others, I am really more of an introverted person who enjoys my own company. I am very observant with things that happen around me and can have mixed emotions at times. 
As the learning styles results predicted, I am a visual learner and tend to learn things more through seeing pictures or watching demonstrations or through observational learning. 
I struggle to get things in my head when someone teaches me by reading something out loud or explaining information without any visual imagery. 


I feel that these results may have a great impact on my behavior when working with a team. 
As an introverted character, I might struggle to socialize with others in a team. However, getting out of my comfort zone and having a mindset to work hard for my goals would help me to get better at this. 
Setting goals for myself, interacting with other team members, and telling them how I feel about things could possibly help me to build great relationships with my team members which would boost my confidence to work hard in group projects.


I need to be more aware that I am not working individually, but with other team members who rely on me and expect work to be done from my side too in order to fulfill great scores for assignments and other class activities. 
Likewise, in a working environment, I should actively engage in group projects and interact with my co-workers. I personally feel like by doing this I can also increase my self-esteem and boost my confidence in socialising and working with others.
