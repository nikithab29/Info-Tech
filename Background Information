I was born in India, and raised in Australia. I graduated from Mount St. Joseph Girls’ college last year and I am currently a first year student studying Bachelor of Information Technology at RMIT University.
At home I speak my mother-tongue, Malayalam and I can also speak fluent English.
I’m passionate about dancing and I am looking forward to exploring and learning new skills as well as meeting new people throughout my time at RMIT University.
